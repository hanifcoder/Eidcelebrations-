          Eid Mubarak or (Arabic: عيد مبارك) is an Arabic term that means “Blessed feast/festival'”.  
        </div>
        <div class="item">The term is used by Arab Muslims, as well as Muslims all over the world. Internationally Muslims use it as a greeting for use on the feast.</div>
        <div class="item">Regional Variations
          Throughout the Muslim world there are numerous other greetings for Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr. The companions of the Prophet Mohammad used to say to each other in Arabic when they met on Eid ul-Fitr: Taqabbalallâhu minnâ wa minkum (which means "[May] God accept from us and you [our fasts and deeds]").</div>
        <div class="item">In the social sense, people usually celebrate Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid al-Adha in the month of Dhul Hijjah (the 12th and final Islamic month).</div>
        <div class="item">Some state that this exchange of greetings is a cultural tradition and not part of any religious obligation.</div>
        <div class="item">Eid in Pakistan:
          Pakistan Urdu speakers, traditionally, only start saying the greeting after the Eid prayer. However, newer generations typically resort to saying the greeting at midnight of the Eid day, similar to other special days such as New Year's Day or birthdays. </div>
        <div class="item">They use the greeting "Eid Mubarak" (Urdu: عید مبارک) which is traditionally replied with "Khair Mubarak" (Urdu: خیر مبارک). "Āp ko bhi Eid Mubarak" (Urdu: آپ کو بھی عید مبارک, lit. 'Eid Mubarak to you as well') is a rising alternative response among the newer urban generations. </div>
        <div class="item">Eid in Canada:
